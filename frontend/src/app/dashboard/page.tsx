// basic button layout -> need to acces how many sections a teacher has, their name and the class name -> create that many buttons/div containers to show
// updated 3/25: added place holder buttons for now to get the styling done for future prs
// need an additional 2 buttons that are alwasy set for compare students and alerts -> respective buttons must be linked to their respective pages
// updated 3/25: buttons now link to the two respective pages using the onlick function and pushing to the route
// an alert icon appears if a section has been detected of cheating
// Updated 3/25: added a section that is set to false, this will be used to add the icon on the sections

// come back to header and replace the teacher name with the actual name assigned to the profile

// one div for the creating the sections

// the other div for the two main buttons at the top

// added a button for the menu in the header

// waiting to see how the team is going to approach linking the pages
// Updated: using stevens pr I updated the buttons to prep for the linking of the pages

// first porition of dashboard is added from stevens pr #39 - features/authentication
