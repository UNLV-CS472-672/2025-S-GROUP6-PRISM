Created by Daniel Levy, 4/19/2025.

This script is designed to analyze C++ blacklisted keywords from
student submissions. The main central script will call this file and
turn a student's submission into an AST that will then be analyzed for
the use of unauthorized keywords. Once all submissions have been checked,
the data will then be sent back to the central script for output file
generation.
