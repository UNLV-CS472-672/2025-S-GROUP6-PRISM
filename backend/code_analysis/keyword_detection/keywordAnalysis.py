Created by Daniel Levy, 4/19/2025.

This script is designed to analyze blacklisted keywords from
student submissions. A user on the front end will manually
input which keywords and/or libraries that students should not
be using in their code. The file will then be sent to this script
for processing all student submissions, and we will return an
error json back to the front end to display the results to the user.
